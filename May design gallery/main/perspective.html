                What should we do? What this situation similar to? Just like finishing dinner, there are lots of dishes and cooking utensils waiting us to tidy up. if we don’t clean up right away after dinner, there will be a mess. However, there are lots of instruments to help us clean it up. We have dished washer, cabinet, dish hanger and so on. The cabinet and dish hanger help us divide the position of placing the utensils, plates, bowls, forks and chopsticks. Companies of kitchen ware try their best to make our work easier.

There are buttons or control panel to control which box you want to open it, this sound like a fiction movie. If the kids take something out, but didn’t put it back, there will be a signal to remind them, which might help the kids to develop a good habit.

              <p class="articleContent"><span class="emphasisWords">The container has different rooms which have labels on it for different varieties of stuffs. The material of the container could be an important part of this product, it is ideal to be foldable and size changeable.

                John, a 15-year- old boy took me to the Auckland Game center, that’s a good chance for me to understand more about teenagers. what impressed me a lot is the dancing machine. Player change their dance steps quickly according to the music. Following the dance on screen, they imitate the dance step of their idols. It was so fun to watch them change their step forth and back according to the music. (I tried to dance quickly like that, but I failed.)

                Not only practicing the agility of the legs, there are other game practicing hand mobility. That kind of games are not a new stuff, we can see that App douYin which is super popular recently, making full use of the element of music, rhythm and dance. Why teens are so obsessed with this? These phenomenon reminds me of Dr.Danielle’s lecture, teens have nothing interesting to do at night, at weekend. There should be some entertainment for them to spend the time. Music and dance are a cool way to have fun. Everybody know how to sing and dance at least a little bit. 
              </p>
              <p class="articleContent">
                During the whole process, they are not only dancing, also compare their scores with other people, and care about whether they can rank top on the list

              <p class="articleContent">
                <span class="emphasisWords">We cannot deny that dancing is becoming a method to release pressure and get rid of loneliness especially students who are living in foreign countries alone and get encouraged from the game during the process.</span>

                Today I help Emi wash Mia and Lui in a bath, they have so many bath toys in the bathtub, such as watering can, duck, superman and so on. During the bath, they made fun with the bubble and use the bubble to make ice cream, that was interesting.
              </p>
              <p class="articleContent">
                Bath toys can be very interesting, I do some research on Amazon, there are floating ship, little fan, fish net and, little pipes, quite interesting. 
                Baby bath always take more than half hour, Babies enjoy staying longer in the bathtub, not only for the bath toy, but also for the bubble bath. They can use the bubble to make ice cream, cake and lots of fun stuff. bubbles can make the baby happier.

              </p>
              <p class="articleContent">
                During the bath, we find something unsatisfied with the packaging :
                the package is quite slippery, especially when you have some soap on the hand, it dropped into the bathtub for twice. So the package need to be improved. Maybe it could be stick to the wall or the shape of the bottle can be easily hold. Waiting to be designed.

                I went to Dr.Danielle’s lecture just now, she showed us the experiment of multitasking for student, and showed us and interesting phenomenon about teenager’s livestream and video chat. People are exposed to the world full of multitasks, people are able to do multitask at the same time. 
              </p>
              <p class="articleContent">
                Her experiment on Livestream of teenagers found that teens(13-17) usually do not know what to do and what to say while they are starting the camera. They might do what their audiences want them to do, most of them have no plan at the beginning. <span class="emphasisWords">What she designed is to develop a small screen to show people her Instagram, Facebook photo or other thing else, try to invoke the topic;</span> It’s quite interesting, isn’t it? 
                First, this is a common phenomenon, people don’t know what to do, but they want to please their viewer. Second, frame the relevant incident into the Livestream is a creative design which we can apply to different design.

When the kids don’t know what to do on weekend, show them the choice, design a web full of the activities that kids or teens can go. Sometimes parents have no idea where they can take their kids to, just show them the activities, club, classes they can join, does it sound interesting?
                When parents don’t know what to buy for their kids, it's good to let them know these toys are the top sale, those are the most popular toys, You can easily sell the product by providing some suggestion.

              <p class="articleContent">
                The color of the poster, shape of the toys the easy-understand videos are the first attraction for them. Girl liked pink and the boy was obsessed with the cool color (dark and blue) with light and advanced effect; Try to make the toy easy, for them if the toys need to be assembled difficultly, they would give up; What’s more, because they are the Japanese kids, they understand Japanese but not Chinese, when I play the video of the toy’s introduction, they were more likely to choose the Japanese one. Make the video interesting seems an effective method to promote the product.
              </p>
              <p class="articleContent">
                I tried to find toys from Japan and Korea. Most of the toys for girls are the small size of the adult world, such as The refrigerator, the ice cream store, the kitchen the dresser, the pizza shop, the baby car acting as the baby sitter… Those toys have all kinds of tools, the shop, the spoon, the money(coin), different kinds of food. Cute shape and the charming color really attract kids eyes.

            <p class="articleContent">Sometimes we would think kids are obsessed with electronic devices these day, but are we realize that the situation of our kids spending large amounts of time in computer game is are due to parents, who don’t have enough time and energy to play with them. In addition, they don’t have pals. Actually, they want to race, play game of hide and seek and other tricky game, interactive game with you, not an electronic one.

            <p class="articleContent">Girl is different from boy, Mia prefer to play babysitting game, cooking game…, she not only want a doll, but also want to place the doll in the cradle, hug it. <span class="emphasisWords">Inspired from it, it will be amazing to design the whole set of toys, including the environment, devices, especially create a story for it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="articleContent">Story is an eternal theme of kids, they enjoy stories from TV and books. They can also create stories by themselves while playing toys. However, kids cannot read before six years old, Story books full of words will not interest them if parents don’t read the stories for them. Audio books will be an alternative choice for them. <span class="emphasisWords">Children’s song player and a story teller will be amazing for them.</span>

            <p class="articleContent">They always asks me to play toys with them. You need to be creative and very patient and make them feel sense of achievement while playing with them. They would act as a restaurant owner, racing driver and other different charactor to simulate the adults' world.</p>
